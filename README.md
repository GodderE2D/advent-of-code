I'm known as GodderE2D on Advent of Code which is linked to my GitHub account. I'm also on [the unofficial discord.js leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/419899). I sometimes discuss mine and other's results in the [discord.js Discord server](https://discord.gg/djs).

# Result Findings

> **Warning**: Spoilers ahead! I recommend only revealing result findings after you've done both parts of the Advent of Code for that day.

## 2022

My first year doing Advent of Code, and so it begins... ðŸ‘€

### Day 1

<details>
<summary>Day 1 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-1/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-1/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

A way to start off Day 1! Calorie counting. Overall, if you know how logic works in programming regardless of which programming language you're using, it should be pretty easy to solve. If you're unsure, remember that Google is your friend! I personally think that Googling problems isn't cheating as long as you're not searching for the Advent of Code solution itself.

You start off by getting a lonnngggg input string of numbers seperated by newlines. A new elf is a double newline, and you have to parse it, get the sum seperated by double newlines, and sort it. In most programming languages, this is fairly simple. I used TypeScript personally. If you're stuck on the sum part because you don't have access to `sum()` in Python and you're using a big-boy language (JavaScript, jk), then you can use `.reduce()`.

### Day 2

<details>
<summary>Day 2 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-2/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-2/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

It's scissors, papers, and rocks, by the way. Either way, you can either do a smart way or the way I did it: a lot of if-else statements (the yanderedev method). Well, at least it works and you're not going to be looking for performance in TypeScript anyways.

You start off by getting some ABC's and XYZ's. Split them by newlines, then split them by spaces. Do a biiigggg loop and add to a total score. I honestly don't know the "smart" way, but if you're not the brightest like me then use if statements for every possible combination. It should be pretty same for Part 2, but instead you assign the round answers manually depending if you win or not.

### Day 3

<details>
<summary>Day 3 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-3/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-3/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

Lots and lots and lots of rucksacks. In Day 3, you have to find compartments in rucksacks, and rucksacks in a group of 3. Find the duplicate values, find their priority according alphabetically (although usually uppercase letters are higher priority than lowercase letters, this is not the case in Advent of Code). Finally, get their sum like every other day we had so far. This one by far took me the longest time to figure out, but it's getting harder each day so I'm not surprised.

For both parts, let's start splitting rucksacks by newlines. Oh, and by the way I'm still using TypeScript. My comfort zone, and type-safe. For Part 1, there's two compartments inside of each rucksack. The first compartment is the first half, the second is the second half. Then, you have to compare the first compartment with the second one: find a letter that's in both compartments. I used a JavaScript [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) to give me unique values in each compartment so I don't have to worry about this later on. Then, you can compare each letter (if you don't know how to get each letter in an array, hint `.split("")`) using `Array.filter()` and if the letter is included in the second compartment. Find the letter's index (using `.split("").indexOf()`) with the lower & uppercase alphabet in its priority order and sum them up!

The Part 2, first you have to group rucksacks in threes by their order. For me, I looped over each rucksack and checked if it's a multiple of 3 (you can use `index % 3 === 0` in JS). If it is, then we'll grab the last 3 rucksacks (including the current one) and push them into another array. Now, we have our groups. Do basically the same thing as Part 1, but now instead of checking two compartments we check with three rucksacks.

### Day 4

<details>
<summary>Day 4 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-4/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-4/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

This one was easier than expected! Could've been good for a Sunday, but I haven't slept yet while writing this so it doesn't count as Sunday for me. In day 4, for part 1, you have to find out if all the duplicate values overlap in two ranges, and in part 2 you have to check if they overlap at all.

Yes, I done today's Advent of Code in TypeScript again. Maybe another day, well, that's what they all say. For part 1, you have to first split the input to pairs, then make a loop to split those to a single range (e.g. `1-4,5-8` to `1-4` and `5-8`). Now, you have to parse the ranges to get all the numbers of that range into an array. There's a lodash method for this, but I'm still striving for dependency-less code so I just copy and pasted a range() function from Stack Overflow (in my defense I did understand how the code works so it's fine). Check if all first values overlap with the second values, and if they do add 1 to a sum. If you're stuck, remember yesterday (day 3)? You have to use a similar `.filter()` function to compare the two, except this time you have to compare them one way and the other way too.

Part 2 was pretty simple this time, basically don't check if everything overlaps, just check if anything overlaps at all. For me, that just means deleting `=== sectionN.length`. All in around 10-15 minutes of work!

### Day 5

<details>
<summary>Day 5 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-5/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-5/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

Wow, what a day. This took me around 2 hours to complete. I really question my programming skills sometimes. In day 5, you have to ship cargo! Rust reference?! Parse an annoying string, and move cargo from one stack to another stack. Again, I did it in TypeScript.

You have to first parse a long string first with two sections: the actual stacks information and instructions. This took me way longer than it should, and regex makes stuff 10x more simple. For part 1, you have to loop over each instruction and remove the last n elements (JS hint: `.splice()`/`.slice()`) from your old stack. Then, reverse the array and add the moving crates (JS hint: `.push()` and spread operator, or, `[...old, ...new]`, make sure `new` is reversed!) to your new stack. Part 2 so far was the most relatively simplest to their preceding part. You basically don't reverse the moving crates when adding it to the new stack. In JS, that's as simple as removing wherever your `.reverse()` is.

### Day 6

<details>
<summary>Day 6 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-6/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-6/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

And we got in a loop of easy-hard-easy again. I highly recommend looking at the examples in the directions, as that helped me a ton. I'm not really a good reader. In the magical technology age of day 6, you have to find markers and find how many letters it is after your marker. I don't know, pre-defined marker and the solution is also called your marker. Today only took me around 15 minutes, and it's the sixth day I'm using TypeScript!

Let's start off by turning our input string to an array of each letter. Set a variable of how many characters are processed, and it's time to loop through each letter! I used a [for...of loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) and looped through [`Array.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/entries) to get both the letter's index and the letter. Increment the characters processed each time, and check if the index is less than the pre-defined marker (part 1: 4; part 2: 14), and if it is we can go to the next iteration of the loop ([`continue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue)). In my method, I used an array and pushed the last n letters one-by-one using a loop and [`Array.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push). This probably isn't the most efficient way, but it will do. Create a new [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), and check if the Set's size is equals to your pre-defined marker. If it is, you can break out of the loop and log your characters processed **minus 1** (since we incremented the characters processed at the start of each loop).

### Day 7

<details>
<summary>Day 7 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-7/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-7/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

> **Note**: Today's code was heavily inspired from [JBPM135's code](https://github.com/JPBM135/advent-of-coding-2022/blob/main/day-07/index.ts). Code has [been legally used](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#5-license-grant-to-other-users).

Well, today was not the most fun. I spent a lot of time thinking about this, and at the end of the day (literally) I ended up taking heavy inspiration from another internet earthling. Thanks, JBPM, if you somehow discover this. I found their solution the most effective for me as it was in TypeScript, easy to understand, and is basically my original logic but bug-free. I cleaned up some things here and there, but mostly it was the same.
  
Ok, here we go. Create a JavaScript [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) or whatever equivalent your language offers, then create a current directory path array. Got it? Now split the input to each line, and first check if it's a `$ cd` command. If it is, remove the end item of the path array if it's a `..` argument, otherwise add the directory name argument to the end of your path array. If it's **the output** of the `$ ls` command (not the `$ ls` command itself!) then do a number-incrementing loop and create a file path string that looks something like this: `/${currentDir.slice(0, count).join("/")}` in a string concatenation. Get the file size, and this is important, **if you get the file path variable from your map and it's undefined, don't add anything**, just [`continue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue) and move on. If there is a size, set the file size from the current line to your map, with the file path being the key. You still with me? For part 1, you have to make a total sum variable, and in JS, an array of the map entries (`[...map.entries()]`). Loop over it, add the size to the total unless the size is over 100,000. For part 2, keep the map entries array (see part 1) and the size needed is `30_000_000-(70_000_000-usedSize)` where used size is the size of your root folder (`map.get("/")`). Filter the map entries array by if the size is larger than or equals to the size needed (the formula earlier). Sort from smallest to largest, get the first value, and you're done. Phew!

### Day 8

<summary>Day 8 Findings</summary>

[[`ðŸ”—` Part 1 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-8/part-1.ts) (TypeScript)  
[[`ðŸ”—` Part 2 Code]](https://github.com/GodderE2D/advent-of-code/blob/main/results/2022/day-8/part-2.ts) (TypeScript)

> **Note**: Today's code was inspired from [tymscar's code](https://github.com/tymscar/Advent-Of-Code/blob/master/2022/typescript/day08/part1.ts). Code have [been legally used](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#5-license-grant-to-other-users).

I thought today was going to be a bit easy, but I guess not. I ended up having to find inspiration (mostly the logic behind it) from a smarter person. Thanks, random Reddit earthling tymscar! In day 8, you have to find the perfect place to build a tree house (or is it treehouse?) one way or another. The first part is by visibility from the outside (kind of to make it secret), and the second part is by visibility from the inside (kind of to make the best view for you).

And let's explain my below-average code again. First off, we're actually going to use some functions today. But before that for part 1, we're going to parse trees into an array (y or rows) of array (x or columns) and convert each string to numbers. Something like this:

```ts
// Input:
1221
3443
5665
7887
// Parsed output:
[
  [1, 2, 2, 1],
  [3, 4, 4, 3],
  [5, 6, 6, 5],
  [7, 8, 8, 7],
]
```

Now, create a function to check if a tree is visible, which is going to take in `x: number, y: number` with the numbers being the respective coordinate (pro-tip: it's best to use 0-index values!). We can do this by getting the left, right, up, and down values.

`1` **`2`** `2` `1`  
**`3`** _**`4`**_ **`4`** **`3`**  
`5` **`6`** `6` `5`  
`7` **`8`** `8` `7`  

If we're using the _**`4`**_ at 1-index `(1, 1)` coordinates, the other bolded values should be selected in their respective direction (left, right, top, bottom). You can use JavaScript [`.slice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) to help you. Be careful about mixing 0-index and 1-index coordinates! After you got all of your values, get the tallest tree in each direction by using [`Math.max()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max) in JS. Then, get the smallest tree in the array we just got using `Math.max()`, which we can use [`Math.min()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min) for (hint: spread operators!) For this function, we'll return `1` if the current tree in the loop is larger than the shortest of the tall trees in each direction (obtained by `Math.min()`), otherwise `0`.

Great. Now, we'll actually get the visibility of each tree. We can [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) the trees array of array, then `.map()` it again for the result of our function we created. To get the total amount of trees, `.map()` the tree visibility we just checked and [`.reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) it so it adds the previous value (so we can get the total value). And we're done for part 1!

For part 2, we have to modify our function a little bit. In our tree visibility function (which is going to repurpose to a function to get the scenic score of a tree), we're gonna suffix [`.reverse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse) to the end of our left and top variables **(not right and bottom!)**. Then, for each direction we're going to run the (soon-created) score of direction function, and return the 4 values times each other for our scenic score function. What's the score of direction function? Well, let's create one! It's going to take in `treesInDirection: number[], currentTree: number` with the numbers being the height. Check if that highest value in the trees in that direction is less than our current tree, if it is we can return the length of trees in our direction. If not, we'll return the index ([`.findIndex()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)) of the tree that's greater than or equals to our current tree and plus 1 outside the `.findIndex(). Outside all of our functions, we'll get the scenic score of each tree by `.map()`ing it and `.map()`ing it again with the tree scenic score function. Finally, we can get the highest scenic score by finding the highest value in that array that's returned from the function we just ran (`Math.max()`).

Remember when I said it was kind of easy when I thought about it? So about that ... nevermind.
